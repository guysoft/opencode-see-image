# opencode-see-image

give non-vision opencode models the ability to see images and screenshots by routing them to a vision-capable model.

when a user attaches a screenshot to a text-only model, opencode rejects it with an error. This plugin intercepts that flow by registering a `see_image` tool that sends the image to a vision model and returns a textual description the primary model can reason about.

when the active model is already vision-capable (its `capabilities.input.image` is true), the plugin stays out of the way: the see_image instructions are not injected, and a stray `see_image` call returns a harmless "you already saw this natively" note instead of an error. beware that this might lead to issues while switching models mid session, so a clean session might fix most of your problems (if any).

## install

**one command (recommended):**
```bash
opencode plugin opencode-see-image --global
```
This installs the package and adds it to your config. Then restart opencode.

**edit config manually:**

Add the plugin to your opencode config:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-see-image"]
}
```
Then restart opencode.

## install via your agent (for some reason?)

ask your agent:
```
install the opencode-see-image plugin
```
it'll run `opencode plugin opencode-see-image --global` and tell you to restart. 

## prerequisites

you need a connected vision-capable provider. The plugin auto-detects whichever you have connected, **either of these work**:

### free (OpenCode Zen)
1. run `/connect` in opencode
2. select **opencode** (OpenCode Zen)
3. paste your API key from [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth)

the plugin uses **mimo-v2.5-free** automatically — if you don't have an OpenCode Go sub, it skips the paid model entirely (no errors) and routes to the free model.

### paid, w/ OpenCode Go
1. run `/connect` in opencode
2. select **opencode-go**
3. paste your API key from [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth)

the plugin prefers **minimax-m3** via opencode-go when available.

### paid, w/ another provider

set the `SEE_IMAGE_*` env vars to point at any Anthropic-Messages-compatible endpoint. see [Configuration](#configuration) below.

**the resolve order:** explicit `SEE_IMAGE_API_KEY` env → configured `SEE_IMAGE_PROVIDER` → `opencode-go` (MiniMax M3) *if you have a Go sub connected* → `opencode` (mimo-v2.5-free). If no Go sub is connected, `opencode-go` is skipped so free users never hit a "model not found" error.

## how the _eye surgery_ works

```
user attaches screenshot
        |
        v
opencode rejects it: 'this model does not support image input'
        |      (the model only sees the filename, or nothing at all)
        v
plugin's system-prompt instructions tell the model to call see_image
        |
        v
see_image tool resolves the image:
  1. asks the opencode server for the session's attachments (exact name,
     then unicode-normalized name, then most recent image)
  2. falls back to reading opencode's SQLite DB directly (this session,
     then any session)
  3. falls back to a filesystem search
  4. if the name matched nothing but the session has an image, uses the
     most recent one anyway
        |
        v
sends the image to the vision model and returns the textual description
        |
        v
primary model answers using the description
```

if everything misses, the error message lists the images actually attached to the session so the model can retry with a correct filename.

## the `see_image` tool

the plugin registers a `see_image` tool with two arguments:

| arg | type | required? | description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `filePath` | string | n | path to the image. Absolute path, or a bare filename like `"Screenshot 2026-06-18 at 17.32.24.png"` to auto-locate. Omit (or pass `"latest"`) to use the most recent image attached to the conversation. |
| `question` | string | n | a specific question about the image. Defaults to a general detailed description. Use this to focus on a particular detail (e.g. `"What error is shown in the terminal?"`). |

your model calls this tool automatically when you attach a screenshot, you don't need to do anything special. The `question` arg is optional; the model uses it when you ask something specific about the image.

## configuration

you can configure the vision route **two ways**: via plugin options in your opencode config (recommended), or via `SEE_IMAGE_*` env vars. The plugin uses opencode's SDK client by default (handles auth automatically). Set `SEE_IMAGE_API_KEY` to bypass the SDK and call an HTTP endpoint directly.

### via plugin options (config)

Set the vision route in your opencode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or `opencode.json` in a project) using the **tuple form** of the `plugin` array entry:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    [
      "opencode-see-image",
      {
        "provider": "egon-proxy",
        "model": "qwen3.6-35b-a3b:latest"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Supported option keys (all optional):

| option | env var fallback | default | description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `provider` | `SEE_IMAGE_PROVIDER` | `opencode-go` | Provider ID for SDK routing |
| `model` | `SEE_IMAGE_MODEL` | `minimax-m3` | Vision model ID |
| `endpoint` | `SEE_IMAGE_ENDPOINT` | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages` | HTTP endpoint (only used with `apiKey`) |
| `apiKey` | `SEE_IMAGE_API_KEY` | _(uses SDK)_ | Bypass SDK, call HTTP endpoint directly |
| `timeout` | `SEE_IMAGE_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Per-candidate timeout in ms. Prevents hanging on slow models. |
| `apiVersion` | `SEE_IMAGE_API_VERSION` | `2023-06-01` | `anthropic-version` header (HTTP mode only) |
| `userAgent` | `SEE_IMAGE_USER_AGENT` | _(Chrome UA)_ | User-Agent header (HTTP mode only) |

**precedence:** per field, resolution is `plugin option → SEE_IMAGE_* env var → built-in default`. Config options take precedence over env vars; env vars remain the fallback when an option is unset. Existing env-var-only setups are unchanged.

### via env vars

all settings are env-var overrides. The plugin uses opencode's SDK client by default (handles auth automatically). Set `SEE_IMAGE_API_KEY` to bypass the SDK and call an HTTP endpoint directly.

| env var | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `SEE_IMAGE_MODEL` | `minimax-m3` | Vision model ID |
| `SEE_IMAGE_PROVIDER` | `opencode-go` | Provider ID for SDK routing |
| `SEE_IMAGE_API_KEY` | _(uses SDK)_ | Bypass SDK, call HTTP endpoint directly |
| `SEE_IMAGE_ENDPOINT` | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages` | HTTP endpoint (only used if `SEE_IMAGE_API_KEY` is set) |
| `SEE_IMAGE_API_VERSION` | `2023-06-01` | `anthropic-version` header (HTTP mode only) |
| `SEE_IMAGE_USER_AGENT` | _(Chrome UA)_ | User-Agent header (HTTP mode only) |
| `SEE_IMAGE_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Per-candidate timeout in ms. Prevents hanging on slow models. |

### using a different vision model

any Anthropic-Messages-compatible endpoint works. for example, to use a direct MiniMax key:

```bash
export SEE_IMAGE_ENDPOINT="https://api.minimax.io/v1/messages"
export SEE_IMAGE_MODEL="minimax-m3"
export SEE_IMAGE_API_KEY="your-minimax-key"
```

to use a different opencode-go model (e.g. Kimi K2.7):

```bash
export SEE_IMAGE_MODEL="kimi-k2.7-code"
```

### verified vision-capable models

**Free (OpenCode Zen):**

| model | Notes |
|---|---|
| `mimo-v2.5-free` |  free. may be a bit slow. default fallback when only Zen is connected (routed via CLI). |
| `big-pickle` | for some reason, big pickle works as an image capable model when called through the sdk w/ an active opencode go sub. |

**paid (OpenCode Go):**

| model | speed | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `minimax-m3` | ~3000ms | default. fast, clean, and accurate. |
| `kimi-k2.7-code` | ~7000ms | clean and accurate. |
| `kimi-k2.6` | ~12000ms | accurate but slow. |
| `qwen3.7-plus` | ~15000ms | slow, spends a bit more tokens because of thinking. |

## updating

**auto-update (built in):** uses the opencode-plugin-update-kit and shows a toast: *"opencode-see-image updated to X.Y.Z, restart opencode to apply"*. You just need to restart opencode to load the new version.

**manual update**:
```bash
opencode plugin opencode-see-image --force --global
```
then restart opencode.

**pin a version** in your config to opt out of auto-updates:
```jsonc
"plugin": ["opencode-see-image@0.4.2"]
```

## platform support

works on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**, in both the **CLI/TUI** (Bun runtime) and the **desktop app** (whose server runs on Node inside Electron). The package ships compiled JS and avoids Bun-only APIs at load time, so it loads on either runtime. Attachment lookup goes through the opencode server API first (works everywhere, including remote workspaces), with a direct SQLite read and a filesystem search as fallbacks.

## file search locations

when opencode rejects an image attachment, the model only receives a bare filename. `see_image` first checks the opencode DB (cross-platform), then falls back to searching these filesystem locations, in order:

**macOS**
1. `$TMPDIR/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_*/` (where macOS stashes dragged screenshots)
2. `$TMPDIR/TemporaryItems/`
3. `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads`, current working directory

**Windows**
1. `%TEMP%` / `%TMP%` (dragged/temp images)
2. `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Screenshots` and the OneDrive-redirected `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots` (Win+PrtScn / Snipping Tool)
3. `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures`
4. `~\Desktop`, `~\Downloads`, current working directory

**Linux**
1. `$TMPDIR` / `/tmp`
2. `~/Pictures/Screenshots`, `~/Pictures`
3. `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads`, current working directory

pass an absolute `filePath` to skip the search.
